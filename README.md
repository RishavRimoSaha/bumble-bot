# üöÄ bumble-bot

A Python-based automation tool using Playwright for Bumble. This bot automatically swipes right on profiles and extends matches by interacting with the "Extend 24 hrs" button. It simulates human-like interactions to minimize detection and streamline Bumble match management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Automatic Right Swipes**: The bot automatically swipes right on Bumble profiles, helping you maximize your match potential.
- **Match Extension**: Automatically extends your matches by interacting with the "Extend 24 hrs" button.
- **Human-Like Interactions**: Simulates human-like behavior by adding random delays, movements, and keyboard interactions to avoid detection.
- **Error Handling & Retries**: Automatically retries failed operations and handles common errors to ensure smooth functioning.
- **Customizable Delays**: Allows customization of delays between actions for more realistic interactions.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Login Automation**: The bot navigates to the Bumble login page and waits for manual phone number input due to CAPTCHA restrictions.
2. **Swiping Logic**: After successful login, the bot simulates arrow key presses to swipe right on profiles.
3. **Match Detection**: The bot scans for match bubbles, identifies those that are expiring, and interacts with them to extend the match.
4. **Random Human-Like Behavior**: Random mouse movements, keyboard presses, and delays are introduced to mimic real user behavior.
